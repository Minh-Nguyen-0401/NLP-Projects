      "the United States. Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has \n",
      "been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., \n",
      "Escherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, \n",
      "Legionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences \n",
      "of many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, \n",
      "malaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore, \n",
      "control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug \n",
      "resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, \n",
      "salmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging \n",
      "infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those \n",
      "in institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and \n",
      "minority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of \n",
